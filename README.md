# 🎶 AirNote – Gesture Controlled Virtual Instrument

**AirNote** is a DIY virtual instrument built with an Arduino Nano ESP32, flex sensors, and MPU6050. It allows you to control musical notes using hand gestures – no strings attached!

## 🧠 Features
- Play notes using finger gestures
- Real-time output on LCD
- Powered by ESP32 + MPU6050
- Experimental sound synthesis using Processing (planned)

## 🔧 Hardware Used
- Arduino Nano ESP32
- Flex Sensors
- MPU6050 (Gyro + Accelerometer)
- LCD (16x2 or OLED)
- Buzzer/Speaker

## 📷 Media

## 📁 Project Structure
- `code/` – Arduino sketch
- `hardware/` – Circuit and part list
- `media/` – Screenshots, GIFs
- `docs/` – Tech explanation

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Flex sensors track finger bends
- MPU6050 tracks hand tilt/gesture
- Values are mapped to musical notes
- Output displayed on LCD and played via buzzer
